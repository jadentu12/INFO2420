<h2>Website 1: Trader Joe's</h2>

<ol>

	<li>The website's theme looks very cordial and easy to navigate. It seems to have the theme of a "market" which is fitting.</li>
	<li>You obviously have to scroll down but there are interactable buttons and images that where you can find more information</li>
	<li>It makes complete sense to me, its just a website for groceries and other food items and recipes. I can easily find any information I want.</li>
	<li>Enhances! There are many fonts, some look like handrwriting which makes it feel more personal to me. The images are also very helpful and make it more interesting. </li>
	<li>It was very fast, didn't seem to have an issue. </li>
	<li>Yes, it all seems to fit together and the text is easy to read.</li>
	<li>There was a navigation bar in the top left and it was very simple to read, not too much overwhelming information. </li>
	<li>Each page had a unique theme based on the type of page that it was, so it was nice to look at</li>
	<li>The text and images only fitted to a small window on my device when I made it extremely small, otherwise it didn't change much.</li>
	<li>It had featured recipes, like something that you would see in a restaurant</li>

<h2>Website 2: Pitchfork</h2>

<ol>

	<li>There was a lot of information to see, but it looked slick and easy to read.</li>
	<li>It has a grid structure with articles in each square</li>
	<li>It makes sense to me, again, there is a lot of information which is expected but it is still readable. </li>
	<li>It enhances it because some of the images are moving and it is a cool feature to add, it makes it feel alive. </li>
	<li>It also loaded instantly, no issues. I also have a very good connection on my device. </li>
	<li>The font looked cool and it was just plain black with a large grey bar for the header. This is why I thought it looked slick.</li>
	<li>This site also had a navigation bar which was even more simple than the last. It containted highlights. </li>
	<li>The grey header bar on the top stayed, which made me feel as if I was still on the same website, which is something I can appreciate. </li>
	<li>The website neatly folded into a list in contrast to a grid system when I made the window small. Very nice to see. </li>
	<li>It was very clear on what articles were most important or trending, be using size and colors and tricks with images.</li>

<h2>Website 3: Jamilin</h2>

<ol>

	<li>It was... very interesting to say the least. There are a lot of pictueres of the lady.</li>
	<li>Despite the weird theme, all the information was still organized into tables and was easy to read. </li>
	<li>It made sense. She offered different types of services and they were split respectively.</li>
	<li>There were 6 pictures of the same woman on the home page, maybe a little less would be nice but the colors and fonts looked good</li>
	<li>This site loaded fairly quickly, I was expecting it to load slower because I had no idea what it acutally was.</li>
	<li>Everything still seemed reasonable, it had sort of a fun feel to it because of the many colors. </li>
	<li>There was a horizontal navigation bar and it seemes easy to use, and very straight forward.</li>
	<li>The main site didnt seems to have a main color scheme, and the other linked sites just had "whatever" as the theme. </li>
	<li>The site did not react at all to the size of the window, regardless of what it was.</li>
	<li>Again, there were so many pictures of the lady! But if she wanted to associate her face with her brand, then I respect it I guess. </li>
